# pagewell

The [PageWell](https://pagewell.ai) skill for coding agents, and the CLI it
drives. An agent with this skill can write a document that looks designed — an
article, a résumé, a report, a handbook — or a single-page interactive
artifact, check it against the template's own rules, and publish it as a link:
a page of its own at `p.pagewell.ai/s/…`, a share link, a share code, or a
single HTML file that opens offline.

`pagewell publish` defaults to a public, searchable page with its own stable
address. It does not create or join a visible Space unless you pass `--space`;
choose `--visibility unlisted|code|password` for a restricted share instead.

## Install the skill

One command, any agent — it finds the agents on this machine and installs into
each of them:

```bash
npx skills add pagewellai/pagewell-skill -g
```

By hand: this repository **is** the skill — `SKILL.md` sits at its root and
the `references/` next to it are what the agent loads on demand — so clone
it into the directory your agent reads (`--depth 1`: the skill is a few
files; the history is not):

| Agent | User-level | Inside a project |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pagewellai/pagewell-skill ~/.claude/skills/pagewell` | `.claude/skills/` |
| Codex | `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pagewellai/pagewell-skill ~/.codex/skills/pagewell` | `.agents/skills/` |
| Cursor | `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pagewellai/pagewell-skill ~/.cursor/skills/pagewell` | `.agents/skills/` |
| Gemini CLI | `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pagewellai/pagewell-skill ~/.gemini/skills/pagewell` | `.agents/skills/` |
| GitHub Copilot | `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pagewellai/pagewell-skill ~/.copilot/skills/pagewell` | `.github/skills/` or `.agents/skills/` |
| Windsurf | `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pagewellai/pagewell-skill ~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/pagewell` | `.windsurf/skills/` |
| Anything else | its skills directory | most also read `.agents/skills/` |

You do not have to install the CLI yourself: the first time the agent needs it,
`SKILL.md` has it run `scripts/install.sh`, which downloads the one binary
this machine needs from the `binaries` branch and verifies it against
`SHA256SUMS` before putting it on your `PATH`. To do it now:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/pagewell/scripts/install.sh    # or wherever the skill landed
```

## Updating

Every activation starts with a read-only check for both halves:

```bash
pagewell doctor --json --skill-version v0.5.0
```

If either half is behind, the JSON includes the exact next command. The manual
commands are:

```bash
pagewell upgrade                  # the CLI: downloads, verifies, and swaps the current binary
npx skills update pagewell -g -y  # the skill text installed globally with npx skills
pagewell upgrade --check          # just say whether there is a newer CLI version
```

Installed by `git clone` instead? `pagewell upgrade` fast-forwards that
clone and re-runs its installer, so text and binary move together. Installed
with `npx skills`? `pagewell upgrade` swaps the binary and reminds you to run
`npx skills update pagewell -g -y` for the text. A copy installed with the one-line
`curl` below has no skill on disk — `upgrade` then replaces the binary only
and says so.

You do not have to remember to check. The skill runs `doctor` before each
task and passes its own published version, so `update` covers the CLI and
`skill_update` covers SKILL.md plus its references. Every later command that
talks to pagewell.ai also learns the current CLI version from the response; a
newer one is mentioned once a day on stderr — never on stdout, so `--json`
stays clean. Set `PAGEWELL_NO_UPDATE_NOTICE=1` to silence that later reminder.

Older versions keep working: the API only ever adds fields, and the server
never refuses a request because of the CLI's version. When a version is older
than the oldest one we still support, the reminder becomes insistent (every
run, `update.required` in `doctor`) but nothing breaks.

## Releases

Every publish is a release with a [semver](https://semver.org) tag, here and on
the source repository: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. A patch bump is fixes and text;
a minor bump adds commands, flags or fields; a major bump is reserved for the
day an old CLI genuinely cannot be served — there has been none. `main` is
always the latest release and `git checkout v0.3.1` gives you the skill text
published under that number. The binaries live on the `binaries` branch,
which always holds the current release only. What changed is in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md); where it came from is in `MANIFEST` and
`version.json`.

## Install only the CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pagewellai/pagewell-skill/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The installer reads `uname`, downloads the matching binary from the
`binaries` branch, verifies it against `SHA256SUMS`, and only then makes
it executable. Nothing else is downloaded and nothing is compiled.

| Platform | Binary | Size |
|---|---|---|
| darwin/amd64 | `pagewell_darwin_amd64` | 15M |
| darwin/arm64 | `pagewell_darwin_arm64` | 14M |
| linux/amd64 | `pagewell_linux_amd64` | 15M |
| linux/arm64 | `pagewell_linux_arm64` | 14M |
| windows/amd64 | `pagewell_windows_amd64.exe` | 15M |
| windows/arm64 | `pagewell_windows_arm64.exe` | 14M |

## First run

```bash
pagewell doctor                       # installed? reachable? signed in?
pagewell templates list --kind doc    # what kinds of page there are
pagewell templates use article -o draft.md
pagewell check draft.md               # the template's own rules, offline
pagewell preview                      # the page as it will render, offline
pagewell auth login                   # a device code; approve it in your browser
pagewell publish draft.md             # one link back
```

Writing, checking, previewing and exporting need no account and no network.
Signing in is only for publishing, and the agent never approves the device
code or completes a payment for you — both happen in your own browser.

## Send an article to X

```bash
pagewell x draft article.md --dry-run   # what X would get, offline, on any plan
pagewell x connect                      # once: a link the user opens to allow PageWell on X
pagewell x draft article.md             # an X Article draft in the user's account
```

Headings, lists, quotes, images, code blocks, tables and `$$` formulas become
X's own blocks; what X has no block for (charts, diagrams, embeds) is
approximated or left out, and the JSON says which. PageWell only creates the
draft — it never publishes; the author does that on X. Sending needs PageWell
Pro, and X itself only offers Articles to Premium accounts. The agent prints the
connect link for the user and never approves it.
