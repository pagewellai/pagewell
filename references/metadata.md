# Metadata in the files

## Markdown front-matter

```markdown

summary: Up and running in three steps
tags: [guide, setup]

template: article            # written by `templates use`; stays what it is
libs: [katex]                # only for $…$ maths; a ```mermaid or ```math fence enables its library itself

```

`template:` names a **template** — today `article` for every document, or
`principle` for a running page (`references/templates.md` says which a request
gets). A template brings its look plus a skeleton, a brief, required inputs,
the components it gives you and checks. `templates use` writes this line; do not
change it afterwards unless they ask for a different template. A file without
it gets the platform's own look (a documentation tree pushed as-is).

Do not add `variant:`. Older documents may carry one, or an old name
(`magazine-article`, `editorial`, `whitepaper`...) that resolves to a template
and variant; those keep working, and `pagewell check` tells you the new name.

Pin a version with `template: article@3.0.0`, or follow the major with
`@^3`. **The default is pinned**: a published piece should not change while its
author is asleep.

`libs:` is opt-in per document. Without it, a ` ```mermaid ` block renders as a
code block — deliberately, because a library is a download and who pays for it
should be an explicit decision. See `libraries.md`.

`token.<name>:` overrides one token for this document. Unknown token names are
an error, not a silent no-op — `pagewell templates list --json` returns the
vocabulary.

Older documents may use `template: resume`, a form: the whole document is in the
front matter (`name`, `contact`, `sections`, `sidebar`…) and there is no body.
Edit the fields; do not convert it. New résumés are written with `article` until
the résumé template returns.

`title` wins over the filename. `summary` falls back to the first ~200
characters of body text.

`theme:` is the old name for `template:` and still works; if both appear,
`template:` wins. An unknown name falls back to the default and shows up as a
warning in `pagewell check` — a typo in an appearance setting never blocks
publishing.

⚠️ Two things **do** block publishing rather than falling back: a retired
template (it cannot be newly used, though documents already using it keep
rendering), and one that needs a newer render engine (`engine_outdated` — update
the CLI). Both fail loudly on purpose: falling back silently would leave the
author believing they had used it.

## HTML `<meta>`

```html
<title>How binary search discards half</title>
<meta name="description" content="Each step throws half the list away">
<meta name="pagewell:kind" content="artifact">
<meta name="pagewell:template" content="principle">
<meta name="pagewell:subject" content="binary search">
<meta name="pagewell:icon" content="📊">
<meta name="pagewell:tags" content="explainer">
```

`pagewell:kind=artifact` marks a running page: always sandboxed, one HTML file,
checked with the artifact rules. `pagewell:template` names an artifact template
(`principle`). Required inputs from
the template's `inputs.yaml` land as `pagewell:<front>` (here `subject`).

A `doc` is Markdown with YAML front matter. Do not put `<meta>` in Markdown.

Anything prefixed `pagewell:` is extracted (the prefix is stripped and the rest
stored in `meta`), plus the standard `description`.

## Ordering from the filename

```
docs/
  01-install.md      → /install, order 1
  02-configure.md    → /configure, order 2
  10-advanced.md     → /advanced, order 10
```

The number is consumed: **the URL never contains `/01-install`**, but the
ordering intent from the filesystem is preserved. The prefix form is `\d{1,4}`
followed by `-`, `_` or `.`.

## index / README

```
guide/index.md   → /guide       (represents the folder itself, no extra level)
guide/README.md  → /guide
```

## Slugs are the server's job

The client sends the **raw title** and the relative path, nothing else. The
`nodes[].path` in the `sync:plan` response is the canonical path the server
resolved — **read that, do not construct your own**.

Normalising on both sides is guaranteed to drift, and when it does, the path
shown in the dry run is not the path that gets stored.

Slugs preserve Unicode and are not transliterated: `团队手册` becomes
`/团队手册`, not `/tuan-dui-shou-ce`.

## [[wiki-link]]

```markdown
See [[install]] and [[guide/faq|the FAQ]].
```

Linking to a page that does not exist yet is fine (a red link). Once the target
is created, links pointing at it resolve automatically — the documents that
reference it do not need to be pushed again.
