# Changelog

Every entry is a release: a semver tag here and on the source repository, one
binary per platform on the `binaries` branch, and the `SKILL.md` that goes with it. Older CLIs keep working —
the API only ever adds fields — but the newest is what the skill text describes.

## v0.5.0 — 2026-10-11

Templates now follow what the user asks for instead of a menu. pagewell preview has no template or variant pickers and no longer reads ?theme=, ?variant= or the pw_theme cookie: every document is shown with the template its own front matter names, which is how it will publish (--template and --variant still give a one-off look without touching any file). The template list shows a template's preview page, and templates use / show put preview_url and screenshots (up to eight, the first is the thumbnail) in the kit when the server has them; offline they are simply absent. The kit lists only the components a template offers, so form and page templates list none. SKILL: a document is written with article, the only document template for now; a page that must run uses principle; a template the user names is used as named. No menu and no variant, and the template stays fixed once written unless the user asks to change it. A résumé is written as an article for now.

Source commit `60584ce`. Update with `pagewell upgrade`.

## v0.4.0 — 2026-10-11

Public pages can now stay out of search engines. pagewell publish --no-index makes the page public but marks it noindex and keeps it off the sitemap and Explore; pagewell visibility <node-id> public --index off|on|inherit changes it for an existing page. searchable in the JSON now reports what the server resolved (page, then space, then account) instead of always true. SKILL: publishing and references/cli.md explain the switch; the README gains a 'Send an article to X' section.

Source commit `e58de46`. Update with `pagewell upgrade`.

## v0.3.1 — 2026-10-10

Sending articles to X is now a PageWell Pro feature. On Free, pagewell x connect and pagewell x draft stop with plan_required and the pricing link before anything is uploaded; pagewell x draft --dry-run still works on every plan. pagewell x status shows the plan state. A connection made on Pro is kept after a downgrade and can always be disconnected. SKILL: the Sending to X section and the plan_required rule say so.

Source commit `8a5204d`. Update with `pagewell upgrade`.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-10-10

New: pagewell x turns a Markdown file into an X Article draft and never publishes it. x draft (with --dry-run, which sends nothing), x connect, x status and x disconnect. Code, tables, formulas and images become X's native blocks; anything X has no block for is listed in warnings. SKILL: a new 'Sending to X' section; references/cli.md and errors.md cover the commands and the x_not_connected / x_rejected codes.

Source commit `cde94e0`. Update with `pagewell upgrade`.

## v0.2.2 — 2026-10-09

A fenced block is its own declaration: write a `` ```mermaid `` fence (or `` ```math ``, `` ```echarts ``, `` ```abc ``) and it renders, in `pagewell preview` and on the published page alike, with no `libs:` front matter. Inline `$…$` and `$$…$$` math still need `libs: [katex]`. Preview also picks up the reader's second pass: diagrams open full screen, code blocks carry a language label and a copy button, callouts are tinted cards, sub-headings use the heading typeface, and table columns follow their content.

Source commit `4f792fc`. Update with `pagewell upgrade`.

## v0.2.1 — 2026-09-19

Keep the public Skill and CLI bundle aligned with the unified Reader Shell release.

Source commit `d6dd59d`. Update with `pagewell upgrade`.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-09-19

Default publish is public and searchable without a visible Space; standalone reader preferences; automatic skill update checks.

Source commit `a8180c0`. Update with `pagewell upgrade`.

## v0.1.1 — 2026-09-14

The skill and the binaries now live on separate branches: main holds the skill text only, binaries holds the prebuilt CLI for the current release. Install with npx skills add pagewellai/pagewell-skill (140 KiB instead of 70 MiB); update the text with npx skills update pagewell and the binary with pagewell upgrade, each of which points at the other. The docs list where to clone for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot and Windsurf.

Source commit `c33defe`. Update with `pagewell upgrade`.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-09-13

First tagged release. Adds `pagewell upgrade`, an update notice after commands when a newer version exists, `update` in `pagewell doctor`, and the `source` share permission (read the author's Markdown/HTML). Explore now lists spaces as well as pages.

Source commit `415887c`. Update with `pagewell upgrade`.
